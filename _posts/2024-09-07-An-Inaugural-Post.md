Hello! This is the first post for this site, hopefully with many more to follow. 

I am a System Administrator who is extremely interested in Cybersecurity and also making my day job easier for me and my colleagues via scripting/automation. If you’re trying to do something similar, you’re in the right place!

Here, I will be posting CTF walkthroughs, Code/Scripts (found on my github), Malware Reversing, Certification Notes/Guides, and anything else that I find interesting.

Welcome!
